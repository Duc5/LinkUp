# 🧡 LinkUp  
*A gentle, physical way to start real-world hangouts*

Meet **Linki** — a small, expressive companion that lives in shared spaces and helps people connect more naturally.

## 🌍 The Problem

In shared living environments — student flats, co-living spaces, dorms — people often want to hang out but don’t.

Not because they don’t care, but because:
- initiating feels awkward or intrusive  
- messages get lost or ignored in group chats  
- there’s no signal that anyone actually *noticed* the invite  
- social effort feels one-sided and unrewarded  

Over time, this friction leads to silence — even when people genuinely want to connect.

## 💡 The Idea

**LinkUp** lowers the emotional barrier to starting a hangout.

Instead of opening a phone or typing a message, users interact with **Linki**, a friendly physical pet that:
- lets you propose a hangout with simple button presses  
- reacts emotionally when something happens  
- shares the invite in a shared physical space  
- gently rewards the act of reaching out  

No apps.  
No notifications.  
No pressure.

## 🐾 Meet Linki

Linki is designed to feel *alive*, not like another screen.

- In idle moments, Linki blinks and looks curious  
- When a hangout is proposed, Linki reacts with surprise  
- When an invite is received, Linki shows the details clearly  
- Over time, Linki reflects social activity in the space  

This emotional feedback turns social coordination into something warm and human.

## 🎮 Making Social Effort Visible

LinkUp introduces a light **Social XP** system.

Each time someone proposes a hangout:
- their Social XP increases  
- progress is shown as a simple bar  
- XP is visible only when the user chooses to check it  

This is not about competition or gamifying friendships.  
It’s about acknowledging effort — even when plans don’t work out.

Trying still counts.

## 🤝 How It Feels to Use

1. You’re in the flat, unsure whether to suggest something  
2. You tap Linki and set a time and place  
3. Linki reacts — your action is acknowledged  
4. The invite is shared in the space  
5. You see your Social XP grow  
6. No awkward follow-ups, no social pressure  

A socially risky action becomes a small, playful moment.

## 🌱 Why LinkUp Matters

LinkUp isn’t about forcing interaction or optimizing schedules.

It’s about:
- reducing social friction  
- normalizing initiation  
- rewarding kindness and effort  
- supporting community wellbeing  

By moving social coordination off phones and into shared physical space, LinkUp helps communities feel more human.

## 🚀 Vision

LinkUp imagines a future where:
- social technology is ambient, not demanding  
- starting a hangout feels safe and encouraged  
- shared spaces actively support connection  

Linki doesn’t tell people what to do —  
it simply makes it easier to reach out.
